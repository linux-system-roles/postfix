postfix
=======
[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linux-system-roles/postfix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/linux-system-roles/postfix)

This role can install, configure and start Postfix MTA.


Role Variables
--------------

This role provides Postfix configuration dictionary 'postfix_conf' which can
hold key/value pairs of all supported Postfix configuration parameters. Keys
not supported by the installed Postfix are ignored.


Example Playbook
-----------------

Install and enable postfix. Configure "relay_domains=$mydestination" and

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  vars:
    postfix_conf:
      relay_domains: "$mydestination"
      relay_host: "example.com"
  roles:
    - postfix
```

Install and enable postfix. Do not run 'postfix check' before restarting
postfix:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  vars:
    postfix_check: false
  roles:
    - postfix
```

Install and enable postfix. Do single backup of main.cf (older backup will be
rewritten) and configure "relay_host=example.com":

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  vars:
    postfix_conf:
      relay_host: "example.com"
    postfix_backup: true
  roles:
    - postfix
```

Install and enable postfix. Do timestamped backup of main.cf and
configure "relay_host=example.com" (if postfix_backup_multiple is
set to true postfix_backup is ignored):

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  vars:
    postfix_conf:
      relay_host: "example.com"
    postfix_backup_multiple: true
  roles:
    - postfix
```
